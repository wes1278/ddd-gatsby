          <p>
            At Dewey Door Doctor, I demand quality work out of my fellow
            craftsman. I do not set deadlines, so that they have the time to do
            it correctly the first time. With this policy, the use of laminated
            stiles/rails, and full 2‚Äù mortise and tennon joinery, we at Dewey
            Door Doctor can guarantee our work for life. Well, actually, my
            life**. When the Lord takes me home, you are on you own. You can be
            assured that I will personally stand behind any Dewey Door Doctor
            product.
          </p>

            ** Please note the care and maintenance of wood doors: Exterior wood
            doors are a high maintenance item. In order to maintain your doors
            properly, all six surfaces of the door (top, bottom, sides, front &
            back) must be sealed as often as necessary to keep moisture out.
            Failure to properly maintain your doors may void any warranty or
