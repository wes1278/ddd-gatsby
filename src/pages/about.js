            About Us
          </h2>
          <p>
            At Dewey Door Doctor I demand quality work out of my fellow
            craftsman. I do not set deadlines so that they have the time to do
            it correctly the first time. With this policy and the use of
            laminated stiles and rails, full 2‚Äù mortise and tennon joinery, we
            at Dewey Door Doctor can guarantee our doors for life. When the Lord
            takes me home, you're on your own. You can be assured that I will
            personally stand behind any Dewey Door Doctor product.
          </p>
