        Striking a balance between human demands and environmental concerns is becoming
        increasingly important. While nature has been bountiful, we must also recognize
        its limitations.

        LYPTUS is a new concept in high quality hardwood, produced in Brazil in a sustainable
        way using advanced environmental technology. LYPTUS is grown in renewable plantations
        interspersed with native species that ensure a balance between ecosystems and protection
        of the environment. Only the best Eucalyptus seedlings are given new homes in the
        forests, and then patiently nurtured and pruned. When a Eucalyptus tree has matured
        enough to produce long lengths of clear wood, it is carefully harvested and processed.

        LYPTUS is manufactured by Aracruz Wood Products in the state of Bahia, Brazil, and
        distributed through an exclusive agreement with Weyerhauser. For three decades Aracruz
        has been a global leader in sustainable forestry, and currently invests more that
        $5 million every year in research and development. It maintains its own nurseries
        and seed banks, and has permanent monitoring in place to ensure optimal soil conditions,
        water quality and ongoing biodiversity. Aracruz was honored with the Marcus Wallenberg
        Prize from the international scientific community for advancements in the field
        of forestry.

        Thus, LYPTUS customers can feel good about using the premium-quality hardwood, and
        also be assured of continuous supplies throughout the future.
