<h1>
Our Guarantee
</h1>
    <p>
        I have been a carpenter for over 35 years. I was trained by a German craftsman that
        always taught me to take the time to do it correctly the first time. Doing anything
        twice was a waist of time and material.
    </p>
    <p>
        At Dewey Door Doctor I demand quality work out of my fellow craftsman. I do not set
        deadlines so that they have the time to do it correctly the first time. With this
        policy and the use of laminated stiles and rails, full 2” mortise and tennon joinery,
        we at Dewey Door Doctor can guarantee our doors for life. Well, my life; once the Lord 
        brings me home, you are on your own. You can be assured that I will personally stand 
        behind any Dewey Door Doctor product.

        Please note: The care and maintenance of wood doors. Exterior wood doors are a high
        maintenance item. In order to maintain your doors properly, all six surfaces of
        the door (top, bottom, sides, front & back.) must be sealed as often as necessary
        to keep moisture out. Failure to properly maintain your doors may void any warranty.
