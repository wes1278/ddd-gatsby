        About Us
    </h1>
    <p>
        At Dewey Door Doctor I demand quality work out of my fellow craftsman. I do not
        set deadlines so that they have the time to do it correctly the first time. With
        this policy and the use of laminated stiles and rails, full 2” mortise and tennon
        joinery, we at Dewey Door Doctor can guarantee our doors for life. When the Lord
        takes me home, you're on your own. You can be assured that I will personally stand
        behind any Dewey Door Doctor product.
